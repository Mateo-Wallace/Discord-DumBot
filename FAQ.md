# This is a test

test

> **Note**
>
> It is possible that the first 2 or 3 times you try to call DumBot it will say "`The application did not respond`" like this:
>
> ![dumbot application did not respond](../images/dumbot-no-response-msg.png)
>
> This is happening because without paying a subscription for DumBot to be up at all times he will go into sleep mode. After 2 or 3 tries this will resolve itself for about 30 minutes of use.
>
> If you would like to stop this from happening I recommend you [Deploy Your Own Instance of DumBot](./Your-Instance.md) and pay for his server to be up at all times. It will typically cost about $5 - $8.
