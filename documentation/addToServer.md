# :icon-download: Add DumBot To Your Server

The existing instance of DumBot does not allow for any customization as all of that is housed within the code. DumBot out of the box comes with all dice rolling and music playing commands. He does not recognize DJ rolls for ease of use.

>:icon-info: **Note**

>To fully customize DumBot see [Hosting Your Instance of DumBot](./hostYourInstance.md)

Once DumBot has been added to your server, try using `/help` in order to see a brief list of usable commands. Full explanations for each command are also detailed on [tbd]()
